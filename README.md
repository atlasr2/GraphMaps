# Chris'es vision

# List of maps

As described in the https://github.com/atlasr2/GraphMaps/issues/6, maps, not organisations, will be in the spotlight. When the tool is launched, it will be possible to create a map with one click. Maps should get tags and comments in the beginning. It should be also possible to add a map to a shared context, or name or describe the context itself.
